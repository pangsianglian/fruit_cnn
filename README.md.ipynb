    "## 🧠 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Accuracy Dropped with Class Weights:\n",
    "- The initial high accuracy was **biased toward majority classes**\n",
    "- Class-weighted loss **rebalanced attention** to underrepresented classes, reducing accuracy but improving fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Accuracy Improved in Later Attempts:\n",
    "- Combined improvements in:\n",
    "  - Label quality\n",
    "  - Model depth and regularization\n",
    "  - Batch size + optimizer tuning\n",
    "  - Longer training duration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Accuracy vs Fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment revealed important trade-offs between **raw accuracy** and **balanced performance** across classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model Version             | Test Accuracy | Notes                                                      |\n",
    "|--------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Baseline (no weights)** | ✅ 95.00%      | High accuracy, but biased toward the majority class        |\n",
    "| **Class-weighted**        | 88.20%         | Lower accuracy, but better fairness for minority classes   |\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Class Weights Reduced Accuracy**:  \n",
    "  The initial high accuracy was biased toward majority fruit types. When we applied class weighting, the model was forced to focus more on underrepresented classes, reducing overall accuracy but improving class balance and fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Accuracy Improved Later**:  \n",
    "  Final improvements came from a **combination of hyperparameter tuning, label correction, regularization (dropout), and training time** — not just architecture depth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **When to Use Which Model**:\n",
    "  - Use the **95% model** when you need strong performance in balanced or demo-friendly settings.\n",
    "  - Use the **class-weighted model** when fairness, minority class recall, or ethical AI are priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best Practice**:  \n",
    "  Report both scores and include metrics like **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**, alongside **confusion matrices** to give a complete picture of model performance.\n",
